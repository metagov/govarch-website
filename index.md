Where will people today turn for inspiration as they develop governance systems for the present and future? 
<br>
<br>
The dominant political practices in many parts of the world have been defined around a narrow set of Western concepts and traditions. But the legacies of human self-governance are much broader than that. 
<br>
<br>
To expand our historical imagination and our repertoires for the future, *governance archaeology* is a strategy for co-producing a global commons of collective governance design. We hope to inspire institutional learning and experimentation, particularly in the face of rapid technological change and vexing global crises.
